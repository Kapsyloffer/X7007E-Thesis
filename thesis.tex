\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Background}
    This thesis is an extension to the Volvo Truck Assembly Line problem (?); 
    Today trucks are placed manually by management workers based solely on their own knowledge, 
    though this is not written down anywhere. 
    The algorithm in the works will using data from Volvo help place the trucks so that there are as few overlaps as possible. 
    My idea is that the algorithm can gain a faster runtime by defaulting to "safe" combinations which are already used today.
    
\section{Research Problem}
\section{Objectives}
\section{How can one intuitively visualize this problem?}
    The UI will visualize the flow of the assembly line on two axes. One per station, and one in clockcycles.

    Issues start to appearing when we start to consider how to properly communicate size in relation to time in seconds when time is measured in an arbitrary unit refered to as clockcycles.

    One clockcycle is the time it takes the theoretical product to make it from one station to the next. Hence the items must be displayed in a way that conveys that some stations take longer and shorter time to complete.

\section{The Algorithm}
\subsection{The Heuristic Approach}

The problem to properly order manufacturing assembly lines with as few overlaps as possible is an NP-Hard problem. 

The Algorithm designed to solve this problem is a heuristic solution that will be made out of a Construction Hieuristic $(C\!H)$ that produces a starting point based on pre-defined constraints, that feeds into a Meta Heuristic $(M\!H)$ that finds a better solution starting from the output of the construction heuristic and self-improving until an acceptable result is returned.

  \node[draw, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=1cm, align=center, right=of CH] (MH) {MH};

  \draw[->] ($(CH.west)+(-2,0)$) -- (CH.west) node[pos=0, above] {input};
  
  \draw[->] (CH.east) -- (MH.west) node[midway, above] {output};

  \draw[->] (MH.east) -- ++(1,0) -- ++(0,1) -- ++(-2,0) -- (MH.north);      

  \draw[->] (MH.east) -- ++(2,0) node[pos=1, below] {result};

\end{tikzpicture}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Complementing the Heuristic Approach using Machine Learning}
Due to the fact that servicemen today place products to be made manually using unwritten knowledge they have accumulated over the years.

The idea is that if they have knowledge of a good enough solution from the get-go with some risk of overlap, then we can train a Deep Learning Model $(M\!L)$ on such previous data to give the algorithm a better starting point, thus reducing the runtime of that algorithm.

        \draw[->] ($(ML.west)+(-2,0)$) -- (ML.west) node[pos=0, above] {input};

        \draw[->] (Data.west) -- (ML.east);

        \draw[->] (ML.north) |- (MH.west);
